When building server-side logic in Stored Procedures, Triggers, UDFs etc. it is useful to have Visual Studio IntelliSense to help you out. Using this wrapper file (DocDbWrapperScript.js) you can enable full server-side IntelliSense for the server-side JS SDK. 

In the JS file you are working on, provide the following path to the file explicitly in comments.
```xml
    <reference group="Generic" />
    <reference path="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\JavaScript\References\DocDbWrapperScript.js" />
```
